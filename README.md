# Z80-Siege
Z80 8 bit arcade siege game.
This is a personal project siege game to practice low level coding using the 8bitworkshop emulator for the Vic Dual Hardware using C.
This project will continously be updated as I make the AI smarter and possibly add more game modes. For now it is on hold. Thanks for playing! 

Game modes:
Player 1 is the white square.
Player 2 is the black square.
  Siege: Travel around the map and try to avoid your opponents tail. If you move into an occupied space you lose! 
  
  Territories: Navigate the play field to place your tiles on the map. Cross over your rival players tiles to turn them to your own.
  If you walk across your own tiles you will change them to the enemy color so beware! If you collide with the wall or the other player you lose automatically.be carefull the AI will try to ram you for a quick win!! First player to 7 wins.
